## patterns we've noticed

1. **visual density matters**: books with rich, detailed illustrations where she can find new things each read hold attention longer (here we are, lpbd series)

2. **lifecycle/transformation books**: strong interest in how things grow/change (how do apples grow, very hungry caterpillar, tap the magic tree)

3. **interactive elements**: different type of engagement - more active participation (press here, tap the magic tree)

4. **memorization = mastery = ready for new**: when she pre-says every word, she's ready to move on (lion inside, koala who could)

5. **lpbd pattern**: works when actions are relatable (dancing, painting, sewing) + visual richness. less engaging when abstract (science concepts)

6. **naming = ownership**: she gives books her own names (apple go, kevin, audrey, coco, time, welcome) - sign of strong connection

7. **nature/animals**: consistent draw across all phases

8. **reading ritual matters**: bottle + bed + blanket + massage + book = optimal engagement

## recommendations to consider

books we're thinking about adding (from earlier research)

**to get:**
- we're going on a bear hunt (michael rosen) - rhythmic, predictable
- lost and found (oliver jeffers) - she likes here we are
- the day the crayons quit (drew daywalt) - visual storytelling

**maybe later:**
- owl babies (martin waddell) - separation theme, might wait
- chicka chicka boom boom - didn't like illustration style

**rejected:**
- lift-the-flap books - too simple for her current level
