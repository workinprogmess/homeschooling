## other books

rest of the collection

## patterns we've noticed

1. **visual density matters**: books with rich, detailed illustrations where she can find new things each read hold attention longer (here we are, lpbd series)

2. **lifecycle/transformation books**: strong interest in how things grow/change (how do apples grow, very hungry caterpillar, tap the magic tree)

3. **interactive elements**: different type of engagement - more active participation (press here, tap the magic tree)

4. **memorization = mastery = ready for new**: when she pre-says every word, she's ready to move on (lion inside, koala who could)

5. **lpbd pattern**: works when actions are relatable (dancing, painting, sewing) + visual richness. less engaging when abstract (science concepts)

6. **naming = ownership**: she gives books her own names (apple go, kevin, audrey, coco, time, welcome) - sign of strong connection

7. **nature/animals**: consistent draw across all phases

8. **reading ritual matters**: bottle + bed + blanket + massage + book = optimal engagement

## recommendations to consider

books we're thinking about adding (from earlier research)

**to get:**
- we're going on a bear hunt (michael rosen) - rhythmic, predictable
- lost and found (oliver jeffers) - she likes here we are
- the day the crayons quit (drew daywalt) - visual storytelling

**maybe later:**
- owl babies (martin waddell) - separation theme, might wait
- chicka chicka boom boom - didn't like illustration style

**rejected:**
- lift-the-flap books - too simple for her current level

---

## new recommendations (jan 2026)

based on patterns + developmental stage (~20mo) - focusing on new authors/styles, discovery over repetition

### vocabulary explosion

| title | author | why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| the big book of words and pictures | ole könnecke | 1500+ words grouped by scenes, european illustration style different from dk |
| richard scarry's best word book ever | richard scarry | dense detailed scenes with labels everywhere, lots to discover |

### numbers beyond counting

| title | author | why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| one is a snail, ten is a crab | april pulley sayre | counting by feet (snail=1, person=2, dog=4), introduces adding/grouping naturally |
| anno's counting book | mitsumasa anno | wordless, same landscape through months with increasing objects, subtle, layered |
| how many? | christopher danielson | asks "how many?" of ambiguous groupings, builds number sense not rote counting |
| quack and count | keith baker | 7 ducklings in different groupings (3+4, 2+5), part-whole relationships |

### science for toddlers

| title | author | why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| baby loves quarks | ruth spiro | actual science simplified, charisse fosberry illustrations, new style |
| the elements | theodore gray | photo-based, gorgeous visual density, coffee table style |
| rosie revere, engineer | andrea beaty | failure/persistence + building/making, different from collection |

### new authors/styles (discovery)

| title | author | why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| over and under the pond | kate messner | cross-section nature, shows above/below water, lifecycle elements |
| the quiet book | deborah underwood | explores kinds of quiet, renata liwska illustrations |
| little blue truck | alice schertle | farm animals, sounds, jill mcelmurry's distinct style |
| rosie's walk | pat hutchins | simple text, visually rich (fox following hen), classic different style |
| the napping house | audrey wood | cumulative story, don wood's detailed paintings, stacking/layering |

### imaginative play books

| title | author | why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| llama llama red pajama | anna dewdney | bedtime routine, emotional resonance |
| maisy series | lucy cousins | maisy does everyday things, models pretend play scenarios |

---

## cause-effect toys & activities

for her developmental stage - cause-effect understanding growing

**toys:**
- ball runs / marble runs (hape quadrilla or simpler) - drop ball, watch path, predict outcome
- stacking/knocking down - kapla blocks, mega bloks - build, topple, repeat
- pop-up toys - push button → thing pops (melissa & doug)
- musical instruments - drum, maraca - action → sound

**activities:**
- water play - pouring, funnels, waterwheels - cause-effect + physics
- simple puzzles with knobs - action → completion

---

## imaginative play (emerging at ~20mo)

**toys/props:**
- play kitchen / food - she'll start "cooking" and "feeding" dolls/you
- baby doll + accessories - bathing, feeding, putting to sleep - mimics her routines
- cleaning toys - broom, mop, dustpan - she'll want to "help"
- doctor kit - check heartbeat, give shots - processing experiences
- phone/keys - pretend conversations (probably already doing this)
- animal figures - schleich, safari ltd - make them walk, talk, eat - early storytelling
- dress-up items - hats, bags, scarves - not full costumes yet, just accessories

---

## top 3 to order (jan 2026)

1. **one is a snail, ten is a crab** - numbers beyond counting, clever concept, new
2. **richard scarry's best word book ever** - vocabulary explosion, visual density she loves
3. **baby loves quarks** - science intro, new author/illustrator, feeds curiosity
