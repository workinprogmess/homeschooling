## not been a fan of

books that haven't clicked (yet)

| # | title | author | notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| 40 | the whale who wanted more | rachel bright | never read it fully, last tried a couple months back, visuals don't help much |
| 41 | amelia earhart | maria isabel sánchez vegara (lpbd) | read a bit, illustrations don't have much for her to engage, read for the airplanes and nice calming visuals |
| 42 | maya angelou | maria isabel sánchez vegara (lpbd) | barely read, hasn't gotten past a page or two, haven't figured out why |
| 43 | mahatma gandhi | maria isabel sánchez vegara (lpbd) | read a few times, visuals after first two pages (when mohandas is a child) don't say much, more in the story than visuals |
| 44 | zaha hadid | maria isabel sánchez vegara (lpbd) | doesn't go past first two pages, even when there's much going on visually |
| 45 | combined book (freddie mercury, mohammed ali, david hockney, charles dickens) | maria isabel sánchez vegara (lpbd) | read a few times: freddie and hockney primarily, once/twice ali, never dickens |
| 46 | the heart and the bottle | oliver jeffers | read a couple times, stopped cause the dad dies - too young to understand death (especially of a father she's so attached to) |
| 47 | a colour of his own | leo lionni | read a few times, played with colour wheel on cover more, just a chameleon in different colors, picks up here & there but not a lot |
| 48 | my little book of (krishna, lakshmi, ganesh, durga, shiva, hanuman) | puffin books | picks up every now and then but doesn't read, just likes covers/characters, reads only lakshmi (and sometimes krishna), not til the end |

## patterns we've noticed

1. **visual density matters**: books with rich, detailed illustrations where she can find new things each read hold attention longer (here we are, lpbd series, richard scarry)

2. **lifecycle/transformation books**: strong interest in how things grow/change (how do apples grow, very hungry caterpillar, tap the magic tree)

3. **interactive elements**: different type of engagement - more active participation (press here, tap the magic tree)

4. **memorization = mastery = ready for new**: when she pre-says every word, she's ready to move on (lion inside, koala who could)

5. **lpbd pattern**: works when actions are relatable (dancing, painting, sewing) + visual richness. less engaging when abstract (science concepts) or visuals lack density

6. **naming = ownership**: she gives books her own names (apple go, kevin, audrey, coco, time, welcome, lion) - sign of strong connection

7. **nature/animals**: consistent draw across all phases

8. **reading ritual matters**: bottle + bed + blanket + massage + book = optimal engagement

9. **shoes obsession**: anything with shoes gets extra attention (red shoes)

10. **hide & seek callbacks**: certain characters (audrey, coco, frida) come back during play

## recommendations to consider

books we're thinking about adding (from earlier research)

**to get:**
- we're going on a bear hunt (michael rosen) - rhythmic, predictable
- lost and found (oliver jeffers) - she likes here we are
- the day the crayons quit (drew daywalt) - visual storytelling

**maybe later:**
- owl babies (martin waddell) - separation theme, might wait

**rejected:**
- lift-the-flap books - too simple for her current level
