## glossary / questions answered

### what is receptive language?
receptive language = the ability to *understand* what's being said. it's the "input" side of language.
- **receptive** = understanding (listening, comprehending)
- **expressive** = producing (speaking, writing)

when mira follows "put potato back and take tomato out instead" - that's receptive language. she *understood* a complex instruction.
when she says "milky" because she's hungry - that's expressive language. she *produced* language to communicate.

receptive usually develops ahead of expressive. kids understand far more than they can say. mira's receptive language is notably strong.

### what are 'simon says' style games?
a game where you give verbal instructions, and the child follows them. for a 19mo, skip the "trick" part (where you're supposed to ignore commands without "simon says"). just use it as a fun instruction-following game:
- "simon says touch your nose!"
- "simon says put your hands up!"
- "simon says jump!"

it practices: listening, comprehension, body awareness, following directions.

### what are 'songs with actions'?
songs where specific movements go with specific lyrics. examples:
- "if you're happy and you know it, clap your hands"
- "head, shoulders, knees and toes"
- "wheels on the bus" (hand movements for wheels, doors, wipers)
- "itsy bitsy spider" (finger movements)

these connect words → actions → rhythm. good for vocabulary, body awareness, sequencing.

**note on mira:** given her natural dance learning with mumma (daily ritual, copies complex choreography, sings along timed), she's already doing something more advanced than simple action songs. action songs might still be useful for predictability/repetition and hindi versions.

### are magnets safe at 19mo?
concern: small magnets are extremely dangerous if swallowed - if two are swallowed separately, they can attract through intestinal walls.

**safe options:**
- large magnetic tiles (magna-tiles, picasso tiles) - magnets enclosed in large plastic
- large magnetic blocks
- magnetic drawing boards (doodlepads) - no loose magnets

**avoid:** small magnetic letters, loose magnets, magnetic fishing games with small pieces

**alternatives for letter learning:** foam letters, wooden letters, letter puzzles, sandpaper letters (montessori style)

### what are accessible art supplies for 19mo?
the idea: art supplies she can access independently, so mark-making becomes self-directed.

**why it matters:**
- pre-writing: scribbling builds motor control for later writing
- self-expression: she can create when *she* wants to
- independence and agency
- sensory exploration

**safe, accessible supplies:**
- chunky crayons (triangular ones don't roll)
- thick washable markers (crayola toddler-safe)
- large paper or roll of paper
- finger paints (supervised)
- play dough / clay (she already does clay tracing)

**use-cases:**
- she wants to "write" like she sees you doing → grabs crayons, scribbles
- finishes a book and wants to "draw" something from it
- processing something and needs an outlet
- bored and explores on her own
- sees letters and wants to try making them

**setup:**
- low shelf or basket she can reach
- specific spot where art happens (easy cleanup surface)
- smock or "art clothes" nearby

**ready for:** chalk on small chalkboard, water painting (brush + water on paper - no mess), thick crayons on large paper

## activities at home

### for receptive language (her strength - keep building)
- treasure hunts with 2-3 step verbal instructions
- "simon says" style games (see glossary)
- sorting games with verbal instructions ("put all the red ones here, blue ones there")
- cooking/helping activities with sequential steps

### for expressive language (where growth is next)
- **narrate back:** when she uses 2-word phrases, expand them back ("you said 'more milk' - you want more milk in your cup?") - *parents already do this, will do more consciously*
- **choices:** "do you want apple or banana?" - encourages verbal response
- **pause and wait:** when you know what she wants, pause to let her attempt words before helping
- **songs with actions:** repetition builds vocabulary and sentence patterns (see glossary)

### for literacy (building on letter recognition)
- **letter sounds (phonics):** she knows letters, next is what sounds they make
- **environmental print:** pointing out letters/words on signs, packaging - *parents already do a lot (tracing, clay, outdoors, airports). she now points them out herself unprompted*
- **tracing letters:** in sand/rice/foam
- magnetic letters on fridge - *wife against magnets, use alternatives*

## books

### ordered / in cart
1. **giraffes can't dance** - giles andreae (rhyming, confidence theme)
2. **the snail and the whale** - julia donaldson (rhythmic, adventure)
3. **slowly slowly slowly said the sloth** - eric carle
4. **tomorrow's alphabet** - george shannon (clever A-Z concept: A is for seed → tomorrow's apple)

### for later (1-2 months)
- **we're going on a bear hunt** - michael rosen (rhythmic, repetitive, can act out)
- **lost and found** - oliver jeffers (simple but emotionally rich - wait for comprehension)
- **the day the crayons quit** - drew daywalt (too texty now, letters funny but repulsive atm)

### considered but passed
- **brown bear brown bear** - too simple, outgrown
- **each peach pear plum** - too simple, outgrown
- **owl babies** - only visual differences page to page, she may not go past page 2/3
- **the gruffalo** - aware of it, papa doesn't like visuals, will check story
- **eating the alphabet** - basically fruits/vegetables, she has 1000 words book covering these
- **a is for apple** - too simple
- **alphaprints abc** - too simple (but alphaprints worksheets good for later)
- **chicka chicka boom boom** - don't like illustrations
- lift-the-flap books in general - too simple for her level

### current favorites (for reference)
- the lion inside
- the koala who could
- (both memorized page by page, pre-says words before they come)

### hindi
- has "j is for jalebi" + big letters of hindi alphabet
- hindi primarily through spoken language/songs for now
- will wait on more hindi books

## homeschool setup

### environment (space)

*principle:* child-sized, accessible, ordered, beautiful (montessori-inspired)

**areas to consider:**
- **reading area:** books on mat in living room, accessible, she chooses. new ritual: reading in bed with blanket, rubbing stomach
- **movement area:** space for dancing, tumbling - living room works
- **practical life area:** low hooks for bag/coat, step stool in kitchen/bathroom, child-sized broom/dustpan
- **art/making area:** low table or floor space, accessible supplies (see glossary)
- **sensory/exploration:** bins for sorting, pouring, transferring (rice, beans, water)

*you don't need a dedicated "school room." the home is the classroom. each activity type has a natural home.*

### routine (not schedule)

avoid rigid time-based schedules at 19mo. think *rhythm* instead - predictability of *sequence* rather than *time*.

**loose daily rhythm:**
- morning: wake, milk, movement/dance time, breakfast
- mid-morning: reading, exploration, outdoor time
- noon: lunch, rest
- afternoon: play, activities, sensory, art
- evening: family time, wind-down, books, bed

toddlers find security in knowing what comes next, not what time it is.

### what to "teach" at 19mo?

not "teaching subjects." instead:
- **follow her interests** (she loves letters? lean in. dancing? lean in)
- **expose broadly** (nature, music, art, stories, movement, social)
- **provide rich environment** (materials, books, experiences)
- **narrate life** (language-rich running commentary on daily activities)

formal "curriculum" is years away. right now: observe, follow, provide, narrate.
