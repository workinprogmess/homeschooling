# 100+ book recommendations for mira (revised)

**based on:** ~20mo, significantly advanced literacy/attention (30-50min sessions), visual density lover, lifecycle/transformation themes, relatable actions, narrative complexity ready

**what works for her:**
- visual density where she finds something new each read
- lifecycle/transformation (how things grow/change)
- lpbd when actions are relatable (dancing, painting, sewing) + visually rich
- narrative depth - she's emotionally processing stories
- naming = ownership (gives books her own names)

**avoiding:**
- lift-the-flap / simple interactive (explicitly outgrown per doc)
- touch-and-feel / texture books (too simple)
- basic word/concept books (outgrown "one thousand things")
- authors she has heavily: rachel bright (3 books), eric carle (2+)
- lpbd she owns: steve jobs, audrey, coco, frida, michelle obama, stephen hawking, princess diana, taylor swift, david attenborough, jane goodall, mother teresa
- lpbd that didn't work: maya angelou, zaha hadid, amelia earhart, mahatma gandhi
- books she already has: press here, tap the magic tree, where is the green sheep, richard scarry's biggest word book ever, spot and friends, from head to toe, very hungry caterpillar

**pricing guide (typical ranges on amazon.in):**
- board book: ₹250-450
- paperback: ₹200-400
- hardcover: ₹350-700
- imported hardcover: ₹600-1500
