- **current stage:** gathering materials

## why this works for mira

**plays to her strengths:**
- ritualistic (5-step reading routine shows she'll take to consistent journaling)
- strong sustained attention (30-50 min reading sessions)
- metacognitive - knows when she's learning; journal gives that awareness tangible form
- loves going deep into visuals - she'll engage with pages she creates
- body autonomy and independence streak - she'll want ownership of "her book"

**developmentally appropriate (19.5mo):**
- scribbling stage = pre-writing, not random marks (building motor patterns)
- stamps/stickers give agency when fine motor can't yet produce what she envisions
- date-stamping introduces time/sequence naturally

**aligns with formative years research:**
- process over product
- real work (meaningful activity, not "kid activity")
- child-led within structure

---

## the ritual

**tie to existing rhythm:**
- pick a consistent time (after breakfast? before nap? balcony time?)
- same spot, same setup each time
- she anticipates it

**structure:**
1. she "opens" the journal (ownership)
2. date stamp (you or her with help)
3. she creates (scribbles, stamps, sticks, glues)
4. you caption briefly in your handwriting (optional, don't overdo)
5. she "closes" the journal

**ownership:**
- she chooses where it lives (her shelf? her mat?)
- psychological ownership first, physical carrying later (2.5-3+)

---

## what goes in the journal

### daily / routine
- weather (stamp or sticker - sun, cloud, rain)
- one thing she ate (draw or sticker)
- who she saw (photo print or person stamp)
- a color she chose today

### events / moments
- balcony meals with ant, fly, birdy - tape in a crumb, stamp a bird
- hide & seek sessions - "mira hid under blanket" in your writing
- new words she used
- a page from a walk (leaf + her scribble + your caption)

### textures / traces
- pressed leaves, flower petals, feathers
- fabric swatches (felt, cotton, jute)
- textured paper pieces
- sand (glued), dried herbs
- tickets, wrappers, small mementos

### feelings (emerging)
- happy face stamp / sad face stamp (you model, she picks up)
- "mira was frustrated with blocks today" - capturing hard moments normalizes them

---

## materials

### the journal
- **type:** blank pages, thick paper (so glue/paint don't bleed through)
- **size:** a5 or a4 (a5 is more portable, a4 gives more space)
- **binding:** spiral or lay-flat (easier for her to work on)

### mark-making
- thick crayons / beeswax crayons (easier grip)
- dot markers (big satisfying marks, less fine motor demand)
- chunky colored pencils

### stamps & ink
- ink pads (multiple colors, washable)
- stamp sets (animals, nature, shapes, weather, faces/emotions)
- rotary date stamp

### stickers
- animal stickers
- nature stickers (flowers, trees, sun, moon, stars)
- shape stickers
- transport stickers (if she's into vehicles)
- emoji/face stickers

### taping & gluing
- washi tape (easy to tear, colorful, frames things)
- glue stick (she can learn to apply)
- small envelopes (tape in, store tiny treasures)

### textures
- fabric swatches (felt squares, cotton scraps, jute pieces)
- textured paper (corrugated, handmade, tissue)
- natural items (collected on walks)

### optional
- small photo prints (moments that can't be pasted otherwise)
- polaroid camera (instant prints for the journal)

## fabric swatches & textured paper - explained

**what they are:**
- small pieces (2x2 inch, 3x3 inch) of different fabrics and papers
- not for drawing on - for touching, feeling, gluing into the journal

**fabric examples:**
- felt (soft, fuzzy)
- cotton (smooth)
- velvet (plush)
- jute/burlap (rough, scratchy)
- satin/silk scraps (slippery, shiny)
- corduroy (ridged)

**textured paper examples:**
- corrugated cardboard (wavy ridges)
- handmade paper (fibrous, uneven)
- tissue paper (crinkly, translucent)
- sandpaper (rough) - small piece
- foil paper (smooth, reflective)
- crepe paper (stretchy, textured)

**why include them:**
- sensory exploration (touch vocabulary expands)
- she can feel her journal, not just see it
- each page becomes multi-sensory
- she learns texture words: "smooth", "rough", "soft", "bumpy"
- connects to real world: "this feels like your blanket", "this is scratchy like the doormat"

**how to use:**
- cut small swatches
- she chooses which to glue on a page
- you can narrate: "you picked the soft one today"
- over time, patterns emerge (does she prefer smooth? rough?)
