## status

- **idea started:** 2026-01-01
- **journal started:** (pending)
- **current stage:** gathering materials

## why this works for mira

**plays to her strengths:**
- ritualistic (5-step reading routine shows she'll take to consistent journaling)
- strong sustained attention (30-50 min reading sessions)
- metacognitive - knows when she's learning; journal gives that awareness tangible form
- loves going deep into visuals - she'll engage with pages she creates
- body autonomy and independence streak - she'll want ownership of "her book"

**developmentally appropriate (19.5mo):**
- scribbling stage = pre-writing, not random marks (building motor patterns)
- stamps/stickers give agency when fine motor can't yet produce what she envisions
- date-stamping introduces time/sequence naturally

**aligns with formative years research:**
- process over product
- real work (meaningful activity, not "kid activity")
- child-led within structure

---

## the ritual

**tie to existing rhythm:**
- pick a consistent time (after breakfast? before nap? balcony time?)
- same spot, same setup each time
- she anticipates it

**structure:**
1. she "opens" the journal (ownership)
2. date stamp (you or her with help)
3. she creates (scribbles, stamps, sticks, glues)
4. you caption briefly in your handwriting (optional, don't overdo)
5. she "closes" the journal

**ownership:**
- she chooses where it lives (her shelf? her mat?)
- psychological ownership first, physical carrying later (2.5-3+)

---

## what goes in the journal

### daily / routine
- weather (stamp or sticker - sun, cloud, rain)
- one thing she ate (draw or sticker)
- who she saw (photo print or person stamp)
- a color she chose today

### events / moments
- balcony meals with ant, fly, birdy - tape in a crumb, stamp a bird
- hide & seek sessions - "mira hid under blanket" in your writing
- new words she used
- a page from a walk (leaf + her scribble + your caption)

### textures / traces
- pressed leaves, flower petals, feathers
- fabric swatches (felt, cotton, jute)
- textured paper pieces
- sand (glued), dried herbs
- tickets, wrappers, small mementos

### feelings (emerging)
- happy face stamp / sad face stamp (you model, she picks up)
- "mira was frustrated with blocks today" - capturing hard moments normalizes them

---

## materials

### the journal
- **type:** blank pages, thick paper (so glue/paint don't bleed through)
- **size:** a5 or a4 (a5 is more portable, a4 gives more space)
- **binding:** spiral or lay-flat (easier for her to work on)

### mark-making
- thick crayons / beeswax crayons (easier grip)
- dot markers (big satisfying marks, less fine motor demand)
- chunky colored pencils

### stamps & ink
- ink pads (multiple colors, washable)
- stamp sets (animals, nature, shapes, weather, faces/emotions)
- rotary date stamp

### stickers
- animal stickers
- nature stickers (flowers, trees, sun, moon, stars)
- shape stickers
- transport stickers (if she's into vehicles)
- emoji/face stickers

### taping & gluing
- washi tape (easy to tear, colorful, frames things)
- glue stick (she can learn to apply)
- small envelopes (tape in, store tiny treasures)

### textures
- fabric swatches (felt squares, cotton scraps, jute pieces)
- textured paper (corrugated, handmade, tissue)
- natural items (collected on walks)

### optional
- small photo prints (moments that can't be pasted otherwise)
- polaroid camera (instant prints for the journal)

## fabric swatches & textured paper - explained

**what they are:**
- small pieces (2x2 inch, 3x3 inch) of different fabrics and papers
- not for drawing on - for touching, feeling, gluing into the journal

**fabric examples:**
- felt (soft, fuzzy)
- cotton (smooth)
- velvet (plush)
- jute/burlap (rough, scratchy)
- satin/silk scraps (slippery, shiny)
- corduroy (ridged)

**textured paper examples:**
- corrugated cardboard (wavy ridges)
- handmade paper (fibrous, uneven)
- tissue paper (crinkly, translucent)
- sandpaper (rough) - small piece
- foil paper (smooth, reflective)
- crepe paper (stretchy, textured)

**why include them:**
- sensory exploration (touch vocabulary expands)
- she can feel her journal, not just see it
- each page becomes multi-sensory
- she learns texture words: "smooth", "rough", "soft", "bumpy"
- connects to real world: "this feels like your blanket", "this is scratchy like the doormat"

## how to use each material

### dot markers

**what they are:** chunky bottles with a sponge tip - press down, get a big colored dot. no fine motor precision needed.

**use cases:**

| use | how it works |
|-----|--------------|
| weather tracking | sun = yellow dot, rain = blue dot, cloudy = gray dot. one dot per day. |
| mood/feelings | happy = yellow, sad = blue, angry = red. she picks the color. |
| counting | "how many crows did we see?" - she dots that many times |
| color of the day | she picks one color to dot on the page. pattern emerges over time. |
| filling shapes | you draw a big circle/heart/star outline, she fills it with dots |
| random expression | she just dots. that's the entry. valid. |
| borders/frames | dot around the edge of a photo, leaf, or sticker |
| connecting things | dot a path between two stickers (bird flying to tree) |

**why they work at this age:**
- instant gratification (press = color)
- no "wrong" way to use them
- big marks feel powerful when you're small
- builds cause-and-effect understanding

---

### glue stick

**what it's for:** attaching things to pages. she learns to apply it herself (messy at first, that's fine).

**what to glue:**

| item | example |
|------|---------|
| leaves/petals | from walks, balcony plants |
| fabric swatches | felt, cotton, jute pieces |
| textured paper | tissue, crepe, handmade paper |
| feathers | found or craft feathers |
| tickets/wrappers | metro ticket, candy wrapper, sticker backing |
| small photos | printed moments |
| cutouts | shapes you cut from magazines/paper |
| natural items | dried flowers, flat seeds, tiny twigs |
| her own drawings | if she draws on separate paper, glue it in |

**the learning:**
- cause and effect (glue makes things stick)
- fine motor (twisting the glue stick, applying pressure)
- decision-making (where does this go?)
- permanence (once it's glued, it stays - different from stickers)

**practical tip:** let her apply glue even if it's "too much" or "in the wrong place." the process is the point.

---

### textures - how to use them

**setup:**
- cut small pieces in advance (2x2 or 3x3 inch)
- keep them in a box or envelope she can access
- offer 3-4 choices at a time (not the whole pile)

**during journal time:**

**option 1: texture of the day**
- she picks one texture to glue on today's page
- you narrate: "you picked the bumpy one" or "that's soft like your blanket"
- over time, patterns emerge (does she always pick soft? avoid rough?)

**option 2: match to mood/moment**
- balcony meal? glue a rough jute piece (like the outdoor mat)
- cozy reading time? glue soft felt (like her blanket)
- rainy day? crinkly tissue paper (sounds like rain)

**option 3: texture story**
- she glues 2-3 textures on one page
- you caption: "smooth, then bumpy, then soft"
- or she arranges them however she wants (no story needed)

**option 4: combine with other materials**
- glue felt, then stamp on top of it
- glue tissue paper, then dot marker through it (colors bleed nicely)
- tape washi around a fabric piece to frame it

**texture vocabulary to narrate:**

| material | words |
|----------|-------|
| felt | soft, fuzzy |
| jute/burlap | rough, scratchy |
| tissue paper | crinkly, thin, see-through |
| velvet | plush, smooth-soft |
| corrugated cardboard | bumpy, ridged |
| cotton | smooth, plain |
| crepe paper | stretchy, wrinkly |

she won't say these words yet - but she's absorbing them. in a few months, she'll start using them.

**why textures matter developmentally:**
- sensory integration: touch is a primary learning channel at this age
- vocabulary: texture words are abstract concepts made concrete
- choice-making: she decides what goes where
- memory: "this is the rough one from when we sat on the balcony"
- cross-modal learning: connecting sight + touch + language
