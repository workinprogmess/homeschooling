### speech & language explosion (20.5 months)

**spatial/relational words - used correctly and physically:**
- under/over: uses the words AND goes under/over things while saying them
- behind/front: hides behind door/curtain, stands in front of swing when asked
- sit down/lie down: uses especially on the bed
- up/down (upar/neeche): bed head is "upar" when she's on the bed; things thrown from balcony are "neeche"; on the see-saw "up up up" then "down"

**action verbs with correct context:**
- pick up / put it: when something falls (pick up), when she places something on table or asks someone else to (put it)
- take it / give: this morning asked yuvaan (his age) to "take it" (green shovel + yellow bucket) while playing in sand; asked mumma to "give" with hand gesture when she wanted blueberries and mumma was saying no

**sentence repetition:**
- copies/repeats pretty much whatever you give her - new words or sentences
- example: "it's late, mimu, lets go to bed, its nini time" - she'd repeat it just like that (jumbling words here and there)

**"new" as a concept:**
- the word "new" is new in her vocabulary
- applies it correctly: new cycle, new book, new clothes, new shoes, new makhana packet

**suffix generalization (-ji):**
- papa said "mamaji" to the househelp while everyone was on the living room couch
- mira was doing something else but heard it (consistent with her ambient listening pattern)
- didn't just learn the word - extracted the suffix and applied it to everyone:
  - baba-ji (papa), mumma-ji, mimu-ji (herself), nani-ji, dadi-ji
  - then extended to objects: sofa-ji, fan-ji

**narrative sequencing (fan cleaning):**
- she'd noticed the dirty fan a few times, calling out "aye haye" (dirty)
- mumma told her someone's coming to clean today
- when the person arrived, she narrated: "uncle, fan, dirty, stool, clean"
- when he finished all the fans: "ho gya" (it's done)

### sound sensitivity & auditory awareness (lifelong pattern, 20m13d)

**context:**
- mira has been sensitive to sounds since birth
- parents initially thought all children are this way
- but her observing nature + high awareness amplifies what she hears and what she derives from sounds
- mostly manifests in positive/useful ways

**positive sound sensitivity examples:**

1. **phone call with nani - picking up nanu's voice:**
   - mira could be doing anything (eating, playing with a toy, coloring)
   - mumma/papa on call with nani
   - nanu says something in the background on nani's end (he's not on the call, not speaking to mira, just said something somewhere in the room)
   - mira says "nanu"
   - she isolated his voice from background audio on a phone speaker

2. **doorbell at nani's house (on phone):**
   - a doorbell rings at nani's house during the call
   - mira says "didi" - referring to the househelp who works at nani's house
   - she heard the doorbell, associated it with nani's house, and predicted who it would be

3. **coming home from walk - fan sound → chain of reasoning:**
   - returning from morning walk/play downstairs
   - mumma opened the front door just enough to tease her / not let her in yet
   - mira heard the fan running inside (she's still outside the door)
   - said "aunty" (househelp)
   - said "pocha" (mopped the floor)
   - said "geela" (must be wet)
   - **the chain**: heard fan → knew aunty turns fan on after mopping → concluded floor was mopped → concluded it must be wet
   - all from hearing a fan through a partially open door

4. **auto/bike passing while coloring (first floor):**
   - coloring together on the first floor
   - auto or bike passes on the ground floor
   - she says "dhyaan se" (please slow down a little, take it easy)
   - picked up vehicle sound from a floor above, applied a safety phrase

5. **neighbor baby crying:**
   - hears a baby crying from the neighbor's house
   - says "it's okay baby"
   - then asks "kilky? tood?" (want milk? food?)
   - empathic response + problem-solving from sound cue alone

6. **waking up late - voices from outside:**
   - mira and papa woke up late one morning
   - she heard voices/chatter from outside
   - said "baba, mumma. aunty. talking. outside."
   - papa confirmed: yes, they are. want to go outside?
   - she said "go go go"
   - identified specific people (mumma and aunty) from muffled conversation through walls

**sensitivity to loud/aggressive sounds:**
- covers her ears when blender/mixer is on
- startled if a dog barks too aggressively
- loud unexpected sounds can scare her

### journaling practice (started & consistent)

**context:**
- journal practice started on-off around 07.01/08.01
- became consistent in last 3-4-5 days (from ~20.01)
- she picks her color box + pens, asks papa to go to balcony, grabs journal
- color box is heavy - says "aaevvviii. help. baba." (her version of "heavy")

**favorite activity: stickers (animals/birds):**
- she picks the animal/bird and color she wants
- papa takes sticker out, she pastes it
- first few days: pasted stickers over each other
- now: uses empty spaces on the page
- today's picks: whale, turtle, 3 different colored birdies

**second favorite: dot markers:**
- has learned the full drill:
  1. asks papa to open (by rotating the cap)
  2. shakes the marker
  3. holds it in the right position (says "hold.." while positioning)
  4. presses down to make the dot
- getting better at pressing vs hitting hard (improving pressure control)

**third: sketches/crayons:**
- does what she wants, not necessarily what's asked
- when papa asks "what color is sky?" she might use any color
- independent creative expression over following prompts

**date stamp:**
- papa date-stamps every page
- she watches intently, trying to understand
- attempts to do it herself but hasn't learned the mechanism yet

**bindi ritual (today):**
- while scribbling with orange sketch pen, said "come baba.. bindi"
- papa bent forward, she sketched orange scribbles on his forehead (uttering "jai jai")
- then walked to sofa to do it on mumma's forehead too
- context: she's absorbed the bindi/tilak ritual from:
  - home wall-hangings of gods
  - dadi's house / nani's house
  - watching 5-10 mins of gurbani/prayers at golden temple daily
  - **possible memory**: ~1-2 months ago at a temple, pandit ji put tikka on our foreheads, tried to do mira's but she resisted (strong body boundaries)
- she calls praying/god "jai jai" - identifies it everywhere (photos, videos, moving roads)
- recent: in cab, saw ganesha idol on dashboard, joined hands and muttered "jai jai" while bending forward on her own
- the journal bindi moment: she created a ritual from absorbed cultural knowledge and applied it through play
- **note on sharing with mumma**: this is her general pattern - if she hugs mumma, she hugs papa too; if she pours tea for papa in pretend play, she does it for mumma too. the sharing is characteristic of how she does things (includes both parents), not specific to this ritual

### environmental observation (general pattern)
- she's super observant of surroundings, sometimes more than adults
- especially heightened in new places (cab, someone's house, unfamiliar environments)
- actively scans and notices details others might miss

### balance bike - first real sit (today, 25.01)
- context: bike arrived 03.01, she'd been avoiding it but also approaching - touching, kissing it occasionally
- tried to sit (barely, nearly) several times but never properly until today
- papa stopped asking after the first few days - let it unfold on its own
- **trigger today:** older kids (10-12yo) came on bicycles, parked by our balcony (mira drops things from balcony daily - clothes, clothespins, colors, pens, shoes, bottles - then calls for uncle/aunty/bhaiya to throw them back, or we go down together to get them)
- when they left, papa asked if she wants to try "like bhaiyas ride their bicycles"
- she said "go go go" and came running in
- **first attempt:** sat on it, couldn't hold it right, it fell
- we picked it up, guided her to hold the handle, walk slowly
- she couldn't understand what "walk slowly while sitting on a bicycle" means (feet were on the ground)
- she tried, walked a few steps
- then said "ho gya" (that's it, let's stop now) - set her own limit
- **papa's reflection:** may have over-expressed excitement in the moment; need to curb emotions on things he cares about more - neutral acknowledgment works better ("you did it" vs big celebration)

### slide - first try (yesterday, 24.01)
- context: big-ish slide in apartment downstairs
- she does the steps (several times daily, up and down, all kinds of ways) confidently
- but refused to do the slide - knows she's scared of letting go completely
- at home: has small slide, does it holding hands many times; has done alone a few times but not consistently yet
- **yesterday:** went up while papa stayed at bottom of slide (so she doesn't fall in sand)
- saw her face when she let herself go - it was scared, but she tried anyway
- didn't repeat it then
- might take a few days before she tries again

### how she works through fears (pattern)
- doesn't avoid fears - circles back to them gradually until they become manageable
- example from 6-9 months: dog toy that does backflips scared her, she'd cry
- by 12 months: kept interacting with it on her own terms, not forced
- became comfortable with its flips - still held papa sometimes but also laughed
- **first instance where papa noticed:** she works on her fears (doesn't let them be), but in her own way/pace/time
- this is a temperamental trait: self-paced exposure to challenging things

### bathroom pretend play - problem solving (refilling)

**context:** continuing bathroom/shampoo pretend play from earlier

**observation:**
- small hotel-size bottles of face cleanser/body wash on the shelf
- she noticed one bottle was empty
- looked at it and said "fishish" (her word for "finish")
- then picked up one of the bigger bottles
- started pouring from the bigger bottle into the empty one

**what's notable:**
- unprompted problem-solving: saw empty → identified the problem → generated solution
- no one taught her this - she extrapolated from observing adults or intuited it
- understood the relationship: big bottle has more, empty bottle needs more
- executed the motor task (pouring) to solve the problem she identified

### basic info
- turned 20 months on 17.01.2026

### pretend play explosion

**toaster & sandwich play:**
- friend gifted her a toaster a few weeks ago
- makes sandwiches for us (me, mumma, aunty/househelp)
- not just serving - expects us to taste AND react
- we must express "mmmmm, it's yum" or similar
- incomplete without the reaction/feedback loop

**tea set play:**
- got a tea set: 4 cups, jars of coffee/sugar/tea/honey, kettle (which we call "milk")
- first time opening (she was sleepy) - played for an hour straight
- plays every day since, sometimes immediately after waking up
- has assigned cup colors: blue = baba, pink = mumma, green = mimu
- offers cups to everyone
- when we ask for "extra milk": sometimes brings kettle and pours, sometimes uses spoon to scoop and put in our cups
- follows requests like "give mumma tea and sugar, baba coffee and honey"
- sometimes mixes up jars (all white with tiny icons + text) - still learning to read/see jar before picking
- learning visual discrimination for similar-looking objects

**bathroom/shampoo pretend play:**
- goes to bathroom on her own
- stands at shelf where shampoos/soaps are kept (at her height)
- sometimes wants to stand on toilet seat for better access
- pretends to pour shampoo, rubs hands, massages her hair/head
- calls papa: "head.. head" - when papa bends down, applies shampoo to his head
- rubs soap on hands and applies to her face
- can do this for 30+ minutes

**birthday cake pretend play (aunty's birthday - ~2 weeks ago):**
- context: it was aunty's (househelp) birthday + nani had gone to someone's birthday party
- next day: opened a drawer, found small birthday candles + matchbox
- ran to mumma: "mumma, cake. cake. candle. mimu."
- we ordered actual cake
- when cake arrived: went back to cupboard, took candles + matchbox, called aunty from another room
- we lit candle, put on cake, she cut it
- sang "happy birthday aunty aunty" (so very happy)
- had 2-3 bites
- repeats "happy budday aunty aunty" + adds "may dod vess you (may god bless you)"

**dadi's birthday (23.01):**
- wished dadi on phone
- after waking from afternoon nap, said to mumma (while on bed): "mumma. cake. order. mimu. eat."
- started singing "happy birthday dadi dadi"
- connected the dots: birthday → cake → order → eat → sing

### self-reference names
- calls herself "mimu" (mumma's name for her)
- also calls herself "doody" (papa's name for her)
- uses both interchangeably

### book inventory observations (from full collection review)

**vocabulary learned from specific books:**
- 'rainbow' from steve jobs (lpbd)
- 'cheers', cutting/sharing cake, parachuting from where is the green sheep

- singing from taylor swift
- sewing from coco chanel
- painting, awareness of feet from frida kahlo
- chimpanzee names (fifi, gigi, dave) from jane goodall
- big/small, stompy & noisy v shy & quiet, different games including chess, clothes from welcome

**conceptual understanding from books:**
- from "what's right, what's wrong": understands that a question can have multiple wrong answers before arriving at a right answer (e.g., what color is banana? blue no, pink no, orange no, yellow yes)

**emotional resonance with books:**
- feels sad on the page when frida meets with an accident
- chuckles at "the nuns thought gabrielle was very strange" in coco chanel (don't know why)
- stopped reading "the heart and the bottle" (oliver jeffers) because the dad dies - too young to understand death, especially of a father she's so very attached to

**book naming patterns (expanded):**
- "apple go" → how do apples grow
- "time" → garden time
- "lion" → the lion inside
- "kevin" → the koala who could
- "audrey" → audrey hepburn
- "coco" → coco chanel
- "welcome" → welcome

**character persistence in play:**
- audrey, coco, frida keep coming back during play, especially during hide & seek
- asks questions like "are you dancing with audrey?" during hide & seek games

**shoes obsession:**
- picks up "red shoes" book because she's obsessed with shoes (especially mumma's red shoes)
- loves the feeling of receiving a box of shoes and trying them out (in the book)

**interactive book engagement:**
- with "press here": sometimes wants to create her own interactions but the next page is pre-fixed, which confuses her
- enacts when koala is about to fall (in "the koala who could")
- looks at her own feet every time when reading about frida's feet

**book preferences pattern - lpbd series:**
- works well when: actions are relatable (dancing, painting, sewing) + visual richness
- doesn't work when: abstract concepts (science) or visuals lack density
- loved: audrey, coco, david attenborough, mother teresa
- hasn't clicked: maya angelou, zaha hadid, mahatma gandhi, amelia earhart

**current collection stats (jan 2026):**
- 48 unique books owned
- 4 current favorites
- 10 currently reading
- 9 all-time classics
- 16 read 50+ times

- "please" - knows when to use it, uses well

**calling & directing people:**
- calling someone: uses "aao, aaja, come, aa jao" as suffix → "baba, aaja" / "mumma, aa jao"
- sending someone away: uses "jao" → "baba, jao" (e.g., playfully wants papa to go to balcony so she can lock him out by sliding door)

**clothing vocabulary:**
- specific words: shoes, socks, bib, diaper, panty, shorts
- everything else: "clothes"

**color + noun combinations:**
- now prefixes colors to describe things

- papa said "good night, doody, sweet dreams, sleep well"
- she came running back saying "huggie" - we hugged

### social awareness & people tracking

**in-the-moment awareness:**
- example: in a car going to gurudwara/temple with mumma, baba, doody, nanu, nani
- she repeats everyone's names to herself (like she does with other things)
- uses "saare" (everyone) with "jai jai" (hindi version of praying to god)
- in a big space where people might not be visible, she asks "nanu?" "nani?"
- especially notices if someone is missing when walking back to car - mentions it

**event-people memory:**
- when we mention christmas, she starts calling out names of friends who visited:
  - neha → "nia"
  - abhishek → "a-jake"
  - anaisha → "shaisha"
  - krishay → "sishay"
- she takes their names as if remembering them, the event, what she did
- does this for a good number of events from the past

## 2026-01-01 / afternoon

### basic info
- current age: 19.5 months

### spatial awareness & environmental navigation

- pointed towards block "e" ahead, understanding we had a few more steps to go
- comprehends spatial orientation, reads environmental signage, and communicates progress toward destination

### feeding patterns

**dream feeds:**
- continues to dream feed at night - at least a couple of bottles of puree + milk during sleep hours
- daytime: still consumes more bottles than solid food

**solid food regression:**
- was doing well on solids (pronthi, chilla, pasta, sandwich, etc.)
- teething + cold/cough + 3 weeks of travel caused regression
- daytime eating gradually improving again

### drooling

- does not like anyone touching her without permission - literally anyone
- exceptions: occasional touch from mumma/papa on certain occasions
- this is consistent and enforced by her

### reading ritual (expanded)
- when she wants to lie down and read, she has a specific routine:
  1. takes a bottle of milk or puree/food
  2. lies down on the bed
  3. blanket on (if not already)
  4. a hand (papa's or mumma's) on stomach/back for massage
  5. a book of her choice that we read while she has milk/puree
- full ritual: bottle + bed + blanket + massage + book

### fine motor & construction play
- starting to spend time on building blocks (egg stands + differently shaped blocks)
- can build up to 5-6 layers with verbal guidance, but acting independently
- knows when to seek help vs when to be independent

### independence vs help-seeking (self-awareness)
- **seeks help:** climbing home-based wooden steps + slider - asks papa to hold her hands while climbing in various adventurous ways, then slides down in different ways (holding one or both hands)
- **insists on independence:** building blocks, making bead strings, answering questions about books after being told once or twice (who lives on the farm? what color is banana?)
- this independent streak has been present from a very early age

### balcony meals & sharing with nature
- mumma and mira developed a new routine: breakfast or lunch on the balcony
- keeps meals simple, less distracting, less running around
- they eat outside with "ant, fly, and birdy" as companions
- learned that when ants/flies aren't there, we leave a little food on the edge of the fencing for them
- **evidence of learning:** one day while reading with papa, mira had a bowl of bhujiya (indian tiny potato mixer); when coming in, she took some pieces out and spread them on the edge, saying to herself "birdy, ant, fly" (in her own broken pronunciations)
- mumma and papa exchanged smiles watching this unprompted behavior

### hide & seek
- loves playing hide & seek at every opportunity
- hiding spots: under the blanket, under a pillow (on bed), behind doors, behind curtains
- if mumma/papa haven't initiated the hunt, she prompts with "are you?"
- the game involves imaginative questions:
  - "are you with the squirrel on the tree?"
  - "are you at nani's house?"
  - "are you taking a bath in your bathtub with your toys?"
  - "are you dancing with audrey or painting with frida or sewing with coco?" (references from little people big dreams books)
- she says "no" to everything, then when asked "where is mira?" or "where is doody doo?" (papa's name) or "mimu?" (mumma's name), she reveals herself with surprise, laughter, and a big smile
- nicknames: doody doo (papa calls her), mimu (mumma calls her)

### reading engagement (depth)
- 40+ books in collection, 80% read 40-50+ times

  - the lion inside, the koala who could, welcome (julia donaldson), the wonderful things you will be, a color of his own, 1000 words, 1000 things, how do apples grow, garden time, the leaf thief, tap the magic tree, press here, here we are (oliver jeffers), the very hungry caterpillar, from head to toe
- reading style: goes deep inside every visual on page/spread
  - the letter, the flower, the butterfly, the number of butterflies
  - who's in the photo frame on the wall, what's the dog/person doing exactly
  - the sun/moon, day/night, letters/numbers
- sustained attention: reads 30-40-50 minutes in one sitting (multiple books)
- current state: seems to have outgrown current collection, may need new books

  - stops dancing if there's a new step mumma tries that she really likes - watches as if wanting to learn it right in that moment
- started singing alongside songs:
  - sings a word or two, or sounds/expressions in between, after every couple of lines
  - across bhajans, dance songs, christmas songs
- uses google home independently:
  - goes close and says "okay gugu (google), pay (play) .. na na na" (for a song she likes)

### observational skills
