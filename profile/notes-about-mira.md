## 2026-01-01 / afternoon

### basic info
- current age: 19.5 months

### spatial awareness & environmental navigation
- walking towards apartment block (e), mira was hungry, in papa's arms
- when asked "what block are we at?", she looked around and said "d"
- pointed towards block "e" ahead, understanding we had a few more steps to go
- comprehends spatial orientation, reads environmental signage, and communicates progress toward destination

### feeding patterns

**dream feeds:**
- continues to dream feed at night - at least a couple of bottles of puree + milk during sleep hours
- daytime: still consumes more bottles than solid food

**solid food regression:**
- was doing well on solids (pronthi, chilla, pasta, sandwich, etc.)
- teething + cold/cough + 3 weeks of travel caused regression
- daytime eating gradually improving again

### drooling
- still drools - continues wearing a bib regardless of outfit
- has slowed down compared to a couple months ago, but not completely stopped

### speech & language (continued significant improvement)

**vocabulary expansion:**
- now uses words for nearly everything
- specific food requests: pronthi, chilla, sandwich, apple, banana
- specific book/song requests: "this book" or "that book", "this song" or "that song"
- action words: "open" (for jar/cupboard)
- social phrases: "hi baba", "hi mumma", "hi tree" (morning greetings to everyone/everything), "bye aunty" (when house help or anyone leaves)
- bilingual usage: "jao, please" / "jao jao" (hindi - go/leave) when she wants mumma to leave or not disturb her

**communication of preferences:**
- clearly expresses when she doesn't want something done
- clearly expresses when she wants something done

### body autonomy & boundaries
- strict body boundaries
- does not like anyone touching her without permission - literally anyone
- exceptions: occasional touch from mumma/papa on certain occasions
- this is consistent and enforced by her

### reading ritual (expanded)
- when she wants to lie down and read, she has a specific routine:
  1. takes a bottle of milk or puree/food
  2. lies down on the bed
  3. blanket on (if not already)
  4. a hand (papa's or mumma's) on stomach/back for massage
  5. a book of her choice that we read while she has milk/puree
- full ritual: bottle + bed + blanket + massage + book

### fine motor & construction play
- starting to spend time on building blocks (egg stands + differently shaped blocks)
- can build up to 5-6 layers with verbal guidance, but acting independently
- knows when to seek help vs when to be independent

### independence vs help-seeking (self-awareness)
- **seeks help:** climbing home-based wooden steps + slider - asks papa to hold her hands while climbing in various adventurous ways, then slides down in different ways (holding one or both hands)
- **insists on independence:** building blocks, making bead strings, answering questions about books after being told once or twice (who lives on the farm? what color is banana?)
- this independent streak has been present from a very early age

### reading engagement (depth)
- 40+ books in collection, 80% read 40-50+ times
- book collection includes:
  - little people big dreams series: steve jobs, audrey hepburn, coco chanel, frida kahlo, stephen hawking, david attenborough, jane goodall, taylor swift, princess diana
  - the lion inside, the koala who could, welcome (julia donaldson), the wonderful things you will be, a color of his own, 1000 words, 1000 things, how do apples grow, garden time, the leaf thief, tap the magic tree, press here, here we are (oliver jeffers), the very hungry caterpillar, from head to toe
- reading style: goes deep inside every visual on page/spread
  - the letter, the flower, the butterfly, the number of butterflies
  - who's in the photo frame on the wall, what's the dog/person doing exactly
  - the sun/moon, day/night, letters/numbers
- sustained attention: reads 30-40-50 minutes in one sitting (multiple books)
- current state: seems to have outgrown current collection, may need new books

  - stops dancing if there's a new step mumma tries that she really likes - watches as if wanting to learn it right in that moment
- started singing alongside songs:
  - sings a word or two, or sounds/expressions in between, after every couple of lines
