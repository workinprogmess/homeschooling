### music & dance
- enjoys/dances to music and songs a lot - daily ritual, sometimes multiple times a day
- copies dance steps very fast, tries deliberately (limited by biology at this age)
- super intentful observer:
  - watches mumma's/papa's feet movement, hand movement, expressions while dancing
  - stops dancing if there's a new step mumma tries that she really likes - watches as if wanting to learn it right in that moment
- started singing alongside songs:
  - sings a word or two, or sounds/expressions in between, after every couple of lines
  - across bhajans, dance songs, christmas songs
- uses google home independently:
  - goes close and says "okay gugu (google), pay (play) .. na na na" (for a song she likes)

### observational skills
- super intentful observer in general (not just during dance)
- watches movements, expressions carefully

- new reading ritual: lying in bed, blanket on, one hand rubbing stomach, reading books

### memory & anticipation
