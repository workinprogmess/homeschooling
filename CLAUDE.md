## ongoing documentation protocol

as we converse:
1. **notes-about-mira.md** (profile/) - when mira-related observations come up naturally (things she does, likes, patterns, behaviors, routines, fears, curiosities), add them to this doc with date/time stamps
2. **developmental-milestones.md** (profile/) - for every new observation added to notes-about-mira.md, create a corresponding entry here with the same date/time stamp, assessing what typical milestones suggest. be thorough.

## wiki system

every doc gets a header block after the title/description:
- **tags:** #tag1 #tag2
- **related:** [doc-name](./path-to-doc.md)

operating rules:
- only update tags/related in the doc you're editing
- wiki/index.md = map of all docs by folder and by tag
- wiki/tags.md = all tags with linked docs
- refresh wiki files on-demand (when adding new docs or weekly)

**tags should be:**
- specific and multi-word (hyphenated): #mira-first-bicycle not #bicycle
- searchable and relatable: what would you search for?
- descriptive: #pedal-bike-from-outside-india not #bike or #eu

---

## documentation structure

add a table of contents at the top of every doc (link to major sections)

source linking format:
- use hyperlinks inline where relevant (reader clicks through to source immediately)
- also include a sources / references section at the bottom (footnote style - for full list of sources)
- format: hyperlink + footnote combined approach

---

## project guidelines

**formatting:**
- everything in lowercase. all research, docs, git commits, and our back-and-forth

**git commits:**
- commit as often as possible
- commit message structure: clear bullets about 'what we did' and a 'why' statement, with a specific title
- no claude code or conductor or sculptor or codex/openai signatures in commits

**journal maintenance:**
- maintain a journal.md as a living and breathing note on progress
- reference git commits + docs/files/code along with notes in plain english about what we did & why
- include date+time stamps with each entry
- arrange in reverse chronology order with latest/newest log on top
