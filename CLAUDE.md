# claude.md

research, documentation, and conversations with claude

## ongoing documentation protocol

as we converse:
1. **notes-about-mira.md** (profile/) - when mira-related observations come up naturally (things she does, likes, patterns, behaviors, routines, fears, curiosities), add them to this doc with date/time stamps
2. **developmental-milestones.md** (profile/) - for every new observation added to notes-about-mira.md, create a corresponding entry here with the same date/time stamp, assessing what typical milestones suggest. be thorough.

## project guidelines

**formatting:**
- everything in lowercase. all research, docs, git commits, and our back-and-forth

**git commits:**
- commit as often as possible
- commit message structure: clear bullets about 'what we did' and a 'why' statement, with a specific title
- no claude code or conductor or sculptor or codex/openai signatures in commits

**journal maintenance:**
- maintain a journal.md as a living and breathing note on progress
- reference git commits + docs/files/code along with notes in plain english about what we did & why
- include date+time stamps with each entry
- arrange in reverse chronology order with latest/newest log on top
