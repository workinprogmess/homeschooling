### initialized project repository

**what we did:**
- initialized git repository in homeschooling folder
- created public github repository at https://github.com/workinprogmess/homeschooling
- connected local repo to remote origin
- established project documentation structure with three core files:
  - claude.md: for research, docs, and claude conversations
  - agents.md: for ai agent notes and workflows
  - journal.md: this living log of project progress

**why:**
- needed version control for the project
- wanted public remote on github to share learnings
- establishing clear documentation patterns from the start helps maintain organization as project grows
- journal format (reverse chronological, plain english, with references) makes it easy to track decisions and progress over time

**files created:**
- /README.md
- /CLAUDE.md
- /agents.md
- /journal.md

**git commits:**
- 74c3a3a: initial commit
