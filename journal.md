### defined project vision and structure

**what we did:**
- renamed branch to `early-days`
- established the three pillars of this project:
  1. **research/** - broad exploration of schooling history, pedagogy, modern learning platforms (khan academy, etc.), ai-first education tools, and what's possible in the near future
  2. **resources/** - curated, personalized resources (books, toys, activities) centered around her developmental stage and needs
  3. **profile/** - free-form observation notes on her - daily patterns, routines, what she can do, what she's learning, likes/dislikes/fears/curiosities - to later draw patterns and insights from
- created folder structure: `/research`, `/resources`, `/profile`

**why:**
- the goal is to reimagine formative years learning, but grounded completely in *her* - who she is as a unique learner
- separating into folders allows each area to grow organically with its own docs
- free-form notes in profile/ lets us capture observations naturally, then pattern-match later

**files created:**
- /research/.gitkeep
- /resources/.gitkeep
- /profile/.gitkeep

### initialized project repository

**what we did:**
- initialized git repository in homeschooling folder
- created public github repository at https://github.com/workinprogmess/homeschooling
- connected local repo to remote origin
- established project documentation structure with three core files:
  - claude.md: for research, docs, and claude conversations
  - agents.md: for ai agent notes and workflows
  - journal.md: this living log of project progress

**why:**
- needed version control for the project
- wanted public remote on github to share learnings
- establishing clear documentation patterns from the start helps maintain organization as project grows
- journal format (reverse chronological, plain english, with references) makes it easy to track decisions and progress over time

**files created:**
- /README.md
- /CLAUDE.md
- /agents.md
- /journal.md

**git commits:**
- 74c3a3a: initial commit
