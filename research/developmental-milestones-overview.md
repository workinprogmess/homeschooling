## major developmental frameworks

two foundational theories shape how we understand child development:

### piaget's cognitive stages

| stage | age | key features |
|-------|-----|--------------|
| **sensorimotor** | 0-2 years | learning through senses and motor activity. object permanence emerges (understanding things exist when out of sight) |
| **preoperational** | 2-7 years | symbolic thinking, language development. egocentric thinking (difficulty seeing others' perspectives). intuitive rather than logical |
| **concrete operational** | 7-11 years | logical thinking about concrete things. understands conservation (quantity stays same despite appearance change). can classify and order |
| **formal operational** | 12+ years | abstract thinking, hypothetical reasoning, deductive logic |

### erikson's psychosocial stages

| stage | age | crisis | healthy outcome |
|-------|-----|--------|-----------------|
| **trust vs. mistrust** | 0-1 year | can i trust the world? | hope, security |
| **autonomy vs. shame/doubt** | 1-3 years | can i do things myself? | will, independence |
| **initiative vs. guilt** | 3-6 years | is it okay for me to do, move, act? | purpose, direction |
| **industry vs. inferiority** | 6-12 years | can i make it in the world? | competence, confidence |

## milestones by domain

### physical development (gross motor)

| age | milestones |
|-----|------------|
| **2 months** | lifts head during tummy time, pushes up on forearms |
| **4 months** | holds head steady, pushes up higher on hands |
| **6 months** | rolls both ways, sits with support, begins sitting independently |
| **9 months** | crawls, pulls to stand, cruises along furniture |
| **12 months** | stands alone, may take first steps (range: 8-18 months is normal) |
| **18 months** | walks well, begins running, climbs |
| **2 years** | runs, kicks ball, walks up stairs with support |
| **3 years** | pedals tricycle, jumps with both feet, climbs well |
| **4 years** | hops on one foot, catches bounced ball, walks downstairs alternating feet |
| **5 years** | skips, somersaults, swings, climbs |
| **6-10 years** | refined coordination, sports skills, grows ~6cm and ~3kg per year |

*who windows for gross motor milestones: sitting without support 3.8-9.4 months, standing alone 6.9-17.4 months, walking alone 8.2-18.0 months. note: 4.3% of infants skip crawling entirely.*

### physical development (fine motor)

| age | milestones |
|-----|------------|
| **2 months** | brings hands to mouth, grasps reflexively |
| **4 months** | reaches for objects, holds rattle briefly |
| **6 months** | transfers objects between hands, rakes with fingers |
| **9 months** | pincer grasp emerging (thumb and finger) |
| **12 months** | pincer grasp refined, bangs objects together, puts things in containers |
| **18 months** | scribbles, stacks 2-4 blocks, turns pages (several at a time) |
| **2 years** | turns pages one at a time, stacks 6+ blocks, copies vertical line |
| **3 years** | copies circle, uses scissors, draws person with 2-4 body parts |
| **4 years** | copies cross and square, draws person with more detail |
| **5 years** | copies triangle, writes some letters, dresses independently |
| **6-8 years** | significant improvement in eye-hand coordination, writes legibly |

### cognitive development

| age | milestones |
|-----|------------|
| **0-4 months** | follows moving objects, recognizes familiar faces |
| **4-8 months** | explores objects with hands and mouth, looks for dropped objects |
| **8-12 months** | object permanence develops, finds hidden objects, imitates actions |
| **12-18 months** | explores cause and effect, uses objects as tools |
| **18-24 months** | pretend play begins, sorts shapes and colors |

*between ages 6-8 and 10-12, major brain growth spurts occur. the frontal lobes mature, enabling better logic, planning, and memory.*

### executive function development

executive functions = cognitive flexibility + working memory + inhibitory control

| age | development |
|-----|-------------|
| **infancy** | foundations emerge |
| **2-3 years** | basic inhibition (can stop an action when asked) |
| **3-5 years** | can shift between simple tasks, hold small amounts in working memory |
| **5-7 years** | inhibition and working memory strengthen; still difficulty with complex tasks |
| **7-10 years** | significant development in planning, error monitoring, cognitive flexibility |
| **10-12+ years** | continued refinement through adolescence into early adulthood |

## play development

mildred parten's stages of play (1932):

| stage | age | description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| **unoccupied play** | 0-3 months | seemingly random movements, sensory exploration |
| **solitary play** | 3 months - 2 years | plays alone, not interested in others |
| **onlooker play** | ~2 years | watches others play but doesn't join |
| **parallel play** | 2-4 years | plays alongside others but not with them. mimics what others do |
| **associative play** | 3-4.5 years | plays with others, shares materials, but no organized activity |
| **cooperative play** | 4+ years | organized play with rules, roles, shared goals |

*parallel play is a transitional stage - children observe and mimic, building skills for cooperative play. some neurodivergent children continue parallel play longer, which is normal for them.*

| **clear-cut attachment** | 7-24 months | strong attachment to primary caregiver, separation/stranger anxiety |
| **goal-corrected partnership** | 24+ months | understands caregiver's goals/feelings, can negotiate |

### separation and stranger anxiety

|-----------|---------------|------|------------|
| **stranger anxiety** | ~8 months | 8-18 months | ~2 years |
| **separation anxiety** | ~8 months | 15-18 months | 2-4 years |

*these are healthy signs of attachment forming. the child recognizes that caregivers are special and doesn't yet understand they'll return.*

## important notes on milestones

### ranges, not deadlines

- milestones represent **when most children (75%+) achieve something**, not when every child should
- the cdc's revised 2022 checklists now use 75th percentile (what most children do by that age) rather than 50th
- wide ranges are normal: walking can happen anywhere from 8-18 months
- missing a single milestone isn't necessarily concerning; patterns matter more

### when to seek evaluation

[cdc guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/act-early/milestones/index.html) recommends evaluation if:
- child is missing multiple milestones for their age
- child loses skills they once had (regression)
- parent has a gut feeling something isn't right

### developmental screening

american academy of pediatrics recommends:
- general developmental screening at 9, 18, and 30 months
- autism screening at 18 and 24 months

### individual variation

- children develop at different rates across domains
- a child advanced in language may be typical in motor skills
- temperament, environment, and opportunity all affect timing
- cultural context shapes what's emphasized and practiced

### neurodivergence

- some children follow different developmental paths
- this doesn't mean "behind" - it means different
- some milestones may come earlier, others later, or in different sequences
- early identification helps with appropriate support
