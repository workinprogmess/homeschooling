## quick take (draft)
- with mira at 90/91 cm and leaning balance-bike first, a light 12" balance bike is the most practical path right now.
- if you want to avoid buying two bikes, a 2-in-1 that removes pedals (and ideally training wheels) is the best compromise, but weight matters.

## evidence snapshot (balance bike vs training wheels)
- a 2025 intervention study found higher success and faster learning for balance bike users (self-launch, ride, brake, independent cycling) compared with training wheels. [pubmed study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39982293/)
- a 2022 questionnaire study found that kids who practiced on balance bikes started earlier, practiced for less time, and rode independently at younger ages than those who used training wheels. [pubmed study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35262200/)
- a 2025 mechanics study explains why balance bikes can be more efficient: they impose balance demands immediately, building adaptive control during learning. [pubmed study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39728250/)
- usa cycling notes balance bikes are lower and lighter and encourage natural leaning and turning; pedal bikes sit higher and rely more on brakes because kids may not reach the ground. [usa cycling overview](https://usacycling.org/article/balance-bike-vs-training-wheels)

## sizing guidance (india)
- decathlon india suggests 12" and 14" bikes for children between 90 cm and 1.05 m, and 10" for 85 cm to 1 m. [decathlon india size guide](https://www.decathlon.in/c/kids-cycles-25541)
- hero cycles also provides a height-based size guide (82-98 cm = 12", 98-106 cm = 14"). [hero cycles size guide](https://www.herocycles.com/sonic-BSSON14BLWH002_main.html)
- use inseam and foot-flat fit rather than age. the seat should allow both feet flat on the ground with a slight knee bend.

## mira fit estimate (90/91 cm)
- 12" is likely the right starting size for a balance bike; 14" may be too tall unless her inseam is long.
- once you measure inseam, we can confirm seat height fit against the bike's minimum saddle height.

## import + customs (india) - baggage vs courier

### if relatives bring the bike as accompanied baggage
- official baggage rules allow duty-free clearance of used personal effects + “other articles” up to rs 50,000 for indian residents/tourists of indian origin arriving from countries other than nepal, bhutan, or myanmar; the allowance cannot be pooled. [baggage rules 2016 (govt of india)](https://www.apcustoms.gov.in/NL/BaggageRules.html)
- goods beyond the free allowance are chargeable at 35% + 3% cess (effective 36.05%) per the traveller guide summary. [travellers guide summary](https://www.referencer.in/Baggage_Rules/Travellers_Guide.aspx)

### if you order directly and ship to india (courier/import)
- duties/igst are assessed at import and collected by the courier; rates vary by hs code and customs valuation, so the final landed cost can be higher than sticker price.
- given the policy differences above, direct shipping is realistic mainly for brands that explicitly offer international shipping (early rider, frog) and will still attract indian import duties.

### example calculation (puky youke classic 12)
- bike price: €299.99 (puky youke classic 12). [puky youke classic 12](https://www.puky.de/en/youke-classic-12-00004126.html)
- example exchange rate: 1 eur = 104.877336 inr (dec 21, 2025). [forbes eur/inr](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/money-transfer/currency-converter/eur-inr/)
- price in inr ≈ 299.99 × 104.877336 ≈ rs 31,462.

**scenario a: arriving passenger with rs 50,000 allowance**
- if the full allowance is available, duty on this bike would be rs 0 because rs 31,462 < rs 50,000. [baggage rules 2016 (govt of india)](https://www.apcustoms.gov.in/NL/BaggageRules.html)

**scenario b: allowance already used or not available**
- dutiable value ≈ rs 31,462.
- duty ≈ 36.05% × rs 31,462 ≈ rs 11,338. [travellers guide summary](https://www.referencer.in/Baggage_Rules/Travellers_Guide.aspx)

## india design-first / boutique leads (non-loud aesthetics)
- [todds](https://www.toddslife.com/pages/about-us) - design-led brand designed, engineered, and handcrafted in india; minimal palette and thoughtful accessories like the wooden stand.
- [vamshycle tipayi](https://vamshycle.com/pages/tipayi) - wooden, minimalist balance bike / ride-on hybrid; 12 months to 5 years; wood aesthetic and minimal branding.
- no verified india-based boutique pedal-bike brands found yet; most design-first pedal bikes appear to be european imports.

## current picks (confirmed)
- todds helmet + wooden wedge (stand) for balance bike setup.

## transition plan (balance bike -> pedal)
1. fit first: seat at a height where both feet are flat and knees slightly bent.
2. glide stage: aim for 5-10 second glides with feet up and steady steering.
3. brake habit: if the balance bike has a hand brake, practice stopping with it.
4. pedal switch: move to a light 12" pedal bike; keep seat low enough for a confident stop.
5. skip training wheels if possible: try direct transition; if needed, use training wheels briefly and raise them slightly to preserve balance skills.

## open questions to finalize a pick
- inseam measurement (floor to crotch)
- who will bring the eu bike (if importing) and whether they have remaining allowance
