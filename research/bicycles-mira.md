# bicycles research: mira (bangalore) - balance vs pedal

## quick take (draft)
- for ~19 months, a light balance bike is usually the fastest path to independent riding, especially for a tall, coordinated toddler.
- if you want to avoid buying two bikes, a 2-in-1 that removes pedals (and ideally training wheels) is the best compromise, but weight matters.

## evidence snapshot (balance bike vs training wheels)
- a 2025 study reports faster learning and higher success on balance bikes vs training wheels (self-start, ride, brake, and independent cycling milestones).
- a 2024 study explains why balance bikes can be more efficient: they require balance immediately and build more adaptive control while learning.
- usa cycling notes balance bikes are lower and lighter; they also encourage natural leaning/turning, while pedal bikes sit higher and rely more on brakes.

## sizing guidance (india)
- hero cycles size guide maps approx rider height to wheel size: 12" for 82-98 cm, 14" for 98-106 cm, 16" for 106-116 cm. use inseam/foot-flat fit rather than age.

## india-available options worth comparing

### balance bikes (aesthetic + functional)
- todds balance bike (12")
  - recommended age: 18m+; weight: 4.5 kg; adjustable seat/handlebar.
- r for rabbit tiny toes trainer balance bike (listed at mothercare)
  - age 2-5y; designed to teach balance + steering first; adjustable seat.
- strider 12 (preloved in india via chubchub)
  - suitable 18 months-5 years; very light (listed ~3 kg).
- beetle toddler 12t balance bike
  - listed as 1-4 years; 12" wheel.

### convertible / pedal-first options
- babyhug 2-in-1 balance bicycle 12"
  - removable pedals and training wheels; listed 2-4 years; carrying capacity 30 kg.
- hero cycles kids lineup (pedal bikes in 12t/14t/16t)
  - use the size guide above; consider models that allow training wheels if you go pedal-first.

## transition plan (balance bike -> pedal)
1. fit first: seat at a height where both feet are flat and knees slightly bent.
2. glide stage: aim for 5-10 second glides with feet up and steady steering.
3. brake habit: if the balance bike has a hand brake, practice stopping with it.
4. pedal switch: move to a light 12" pedal bike; keep seat low enough for a confident stop.
5. skip training wheels if possible: try direct transition; if needed, use training wheels briefly and raise them slightly to preserve balance skills.

## open questions to finalize a pick
- mira's height + inseam (floor to crotch), and whether she can run confidently
- preferred budget range
- where she will ride (smooth floor, park paths, or uneven roads)
- do you want a single convertible bike or are you ok with a balance bike first?
