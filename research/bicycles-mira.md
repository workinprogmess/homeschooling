# bicycles research: mira (bangalore) - balance vs pedal

## related

- [developmental milestones](../profile/developmental-milestones.md)

## quick take (draft)
- with mira at 90/91 cm and leaning balance-bike first, a light 12" balance bike is the most practical path right now.
- if you want to avoid buying two bikes, a 2-in-1 that removes pedals (and ideally training wheels) is the best compromise, but weight matters.

## evidence snapshot (balance bike vs training wheels)
- a 2025 intervention study found higher success and faster learning for balance bike users (self-launch, ride, brake, independent cycling) compared with training wheels. [pubmed study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39982293/)
- a 2022 questionnaire study found that kids who practiced on balance bikes started earlier, practiced for less time, and rode independently at younger ages than those who used training wheels. [pubmed study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35262200/)
- a 2025 mechanics study explains why balance bikes can be more efficient: they impose balance demands immediately, building adaptive control during learning. [pubmed study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39728250/)
- usa cycling notes balance bikes are lower and lighter and encourage natural leaning and turning; pedal bikes sit higher and rely more on brakes because kids may not reach the ground. [usa cycling overview](https://usacycling.org/article/balance-bike-vs-training-wheels)

## sizing guidance (india)
- decathlon india suggests 12" and 14" bikes for children between 90 cm and 1.05 m, and 10" for 85 cm to 1 m. [decathlon india size guide](https://www.decathlon.in/c/kids-cycles-25541)
- hero cycles also provides a height-based size guide (82-98 cm = 12", 98-106 cm = 14"). [hero cycles size guide](https://www.herocycles.com/sonic-BSSON14BLWH002_main.html)
- use inseam and foot-flat fit rather than age. the seat should allow both feet flat on the ground with a slight knee bend.

## mira fit estimate (90/91 cm)
- 12" is likely the right starting size for a balance bike; 14" may be too tall unless her inseam is long.
- once you measure inseam, we can confirm seat height fit against the bike's minimum saddle height.

### regular pedal bikes (aesthetic alternatives, india)
- [decathlon india kids cycles](https://www.decathlon.in/c/kids-cycles-25541)
  - 12" and 14" options; helpful for sizing and availability.
- [hero cycles sonic 14t](https://www.herocycles.com/sonic-BSSON14BLWH002_main.html)
  - option for later once she is taller; use the height-based size guide above.
- [hero cycles jimmy 14t](https://www.herocycles.com/jimmy-BSJIM14WH00001.html)
  - another 14t option for later; check fit using height and inseam.

## transition plan (balance bike -> pedal)
1. fit first: seat at a height where both feet are flat and knees slightly bent.
2. glide stage: aim for 5-10 second glides with feet up and steady steering.
3. brake habit: if the balance bike has a hand brake, practice stopping with it.
4. pedal switch: move to a light 12" pedal bike; keep seat low enough for a confident stop.
5. skip training wheels if possible: try direct transition; if needed, use training wheels briefly and raise them slightly to preserve balance skills.

## open questions to finalize a pick
- inseam measurement (floor to crotch)
- helmet choice and size (if needed, we can add to this doc)
